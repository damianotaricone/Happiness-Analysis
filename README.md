# Happiness-Analysis
The script you've shared seems to be a comprehensive analysis of a dataset, likely related to country-wise happiness scores, using various statistical and machine learning techniques in R. Let's go through it section by section:

### Library Imports
- You're importing a range of libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. This includes `mclust` for clustering, `magrittr` and `tidyr` for data manipulation, `ggplot2` and `plotly` for visualization, and others like `lme4`, `haven`, `clustvarsel` for various statistical analyses.

### Descriptive Analysis
- **Dataset Loading:** You load a dataset named `X2018` into a variable called `data`.
- **Correlation Plot:** A plot is created to visualize correlations and linear trends among variables, along with identifying different density groups and outliers.
- **Missing Values:** You check for missing values in each variable.
- **Barplot of Scores:** There's a bar plot depicting happiness scores across countries, highlighting a generally descending trend and some notable drops.
- **Top and Bottom 20 Countries:** You extract and print lists of the top 20 happiest and least happy countries.

### Composition Chart
- **Variable Composition:** You create a bar chart showing the composition of scores based on different contributing factors (like GDP, social support, etc.).
- **Data Transformation:** The dataset is melted for this visualization using `reshape2`.

### Regression Analysis
- **Top and Bottom 20 Countries Analysis:** You separate the top and bottom 20 countries for further analysis.
- **Scatter Plots:** Multiple scatter plots are created to analyze relationships between various pairs of variables like GDP and happiness score, corruption perception, social support, etc.
- **Interaction with Plots:** The plots are made interactive using `plotly`.

### Boxplots and Standardization
- **Boxplot of Variables:** You create boxplots for different variables.
- **Data Standardization:** The variables are standardized, and boxplots are redrawn to reflect this standardization.

### Clustering Analysis
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** You perform hierarchical clustering using the Ward method.
- **K-means Clustering:** K-means clustering is performed, and the results are visualized and tabulated.
- **Mclust for Score Distribution:** Gaussian Mixture Models are used to cluster the 'Score' variable.
- **Histogram of Scores:** A histogram is generated for the 'Score' variable.

### Variable Selection
- **Heatmap of Correlations:** A heatmap is created to visualize correlations between selected variables.
- **Boruta for Variable Importance:** The Boruta algorithm is used to find important variables in predicting happiness scores.
- **Clustvarsel:** This is used for variable selection in clustering. It identifies the most relevant variables for clustering.

### Comments on Specific Sections:
- **Understanding and Contextualizing Data:** It's crucial to have a clear understanding of the data you're working with. For instance, what does each variable represent? Is it a country's economic status, health metrics, social factors, etc.?
- **Plot Interpretations:** Each plot and analysis should be interpreted in the context of the dataset. For example, how does GDP relate to happiness scores? What do outliers represent?
- **Clustering Rationale:** When performing clustering, it's important to understand why certain variables are chosen and how they impact the clustering results.
- **Robustness and Validation:** Ensure that the methodologies used are robust and validate the findings, especially in cases of clustering and variable selection.

Overall, this script is a thorough exploration of a dataset, presumably related to happiness scores by country, using various statistical techniques and visualizations. Each step is crucial for understanding different aspects of the data and deriving meaningful insights.
